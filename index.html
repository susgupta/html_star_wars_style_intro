                It is a period of strife for designers.
                The sinister SKETCH EMPIRE has risen from the ashes and will not rest until all easy, simple DESIGN
                TOOLS have been destroyed. Basically to continue their quest to make all designers' lives more
                complicated.
            </p>
            <p>
                With the support of the GALACTIC DESIGNER COUNCIL, a brave RESISTANCE of designers is formed to
                restore sanity and simplicity from the clutches of the evil SKETCH EMPIRE.
            </p>
            <p>
                These designers have discovered the power that binds simple, fast and fun UI/UX Design.
            </p>
            <p>
                Using a tool called FIGMA, these valiant designers, hope to once again restore sanity, simplicity and
                fun to the design
                galaxy....
